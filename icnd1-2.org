* Error detection =/= Error correction
** Datalink does a Frame Check sequence. This helps receiving interfaces detect if a frame has been corrupted

* References to data a different layers of OSI model
** Application, Presentation, Session
*** Data
** Transport
*** Segment
** Network Layer
*** Packet
** Data Link
*** Frame
** Physical
*** Bits

* Protocol Data Unit
** Combination of data and layer specific header.
** The data link layer has a header and a footer.

* Same layer interaction
** When layers interact with each other on different hosts
* Adjacent layer interaction
** When layers interact with each other on the same host

* TCP/IP Networking Model

* TCP
** Performs *windowing*
** Performs error detection
** Connection-Oriented
** Guaranteed delivery

** Three-Way Handshake
*** Initial Sequence Number (ISN)
*** TCP SYN sent with ISN
*** size of Window: Number of bytes the recipient is willing to receive before an ACK packet is returned.
*** TCP SYN\ACK is sent back
*** Initiating server sends confirmation of SYN\ACK and announces end of handshake

** Four-Way Handshake
Terminates a TCP session
-> FIN, ACK
<- ACK
<- ACK,FIN
-> ACK

** Cumulative acknowledgement
Receiving host sends and ack with the next sequences number expected. This helps the sender determine if segments are lost.

** Window Size & Flow Control
Dynamic. Receiving host and change this value if it's successfully receiving segments

* UDP
** No Handshake
** No Flow Control
** Connectionless

* Multiplexing
Allows a single data stream to handle different types of traffic simultaneously.

* Common port numbers
TFTP: UDP port 69
HTTP: TCP port 80
HTTPS: TCP port 443
SMTP: TCP port 25
Telnet: 23
POP3: TCP port 110
DHCP: UDP ports 67,68

** Ports under 1024 are reserved.
